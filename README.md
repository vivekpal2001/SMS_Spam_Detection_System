📲 SMS Spam Detection System 🚫✉️
📝 Project Overview
The SMS Spam Detection project aims to automatically classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam) using various machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing SMS data, transforming the text into numerical features, and training multiple models to predict whether a message is spam. This project can be used as a foundation for applications like spam filtering in emails and messaging services. 🛡️📧

🔧 Key Components
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing SMS text data.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical representations.
Model Training: Comparing different machine learning models to find the best-performing one.
Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision for evaluation.
🎥 Demo
Here's an example of how the model works:

SMS Message	Prediction
"Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card!"	Spam
"Hey, can we reschedule our meeting to tomorrow?"	Ham
✨ Features
Real-time SMS Spam Detection: Predict whether an incoming message is spam or ham.
Multiple Model Comparison: Evaluate various machine learning algorithms for classification.
Visualization Tools: Graphs and plots for better understanding of model performance.
Pretrained Models: Use saved models for real-time predictions on new data.
Text Preprocessing Techniques: Convert raw text into meaningful features for model training.
📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which consists of approximately 5,572 SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham." Each message is preprocessed to remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and handle stopwords.

Column	Description
Label	Indicates if the message is spam or ham.
Message	The actual text of the SMS message.
